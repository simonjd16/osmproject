# P3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data - OpenStreetMap Project

## Map Area
Newbury, Berkshire, United Kingdom


The area I chose contained the area surrounding my hometown. I am a keen cyclyst that uses the OpenStreetMap data to not only plan my cycling routes before a ride but also use them for mapping on my Garmin cycling computer while out on a ride. Having the opportunity to improve the local mapping would not only benefit the community but also my route planning and navigation at the same time.
